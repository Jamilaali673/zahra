                    Nature has provided us numerous gifts such as air,<br>
                     water, land, sunlight, minerals, plants, and animals. <br>
                      All these gifts of nature make our earth a place worth living. <br> 
                      Existence on Earth would not be possible without any of these. <br>
                       Now, while these natural resources are present on Earth in plenty. <br>
                        Unfortunately, the necessity of most of these has increased extremely over
                         the centuries <br> due to growth in the human population.
